# Simon-Shoot

You can press any key to start and it shows the tile's pattern to remember. As you go up from level to level the patterns will get more complicated to remember and at some point you are going to screw up and then it will tell you that Game is Over! 

Then to restart the game you can press any key according to your wish:)

Happy Coding:)
